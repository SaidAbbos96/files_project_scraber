# üöÄ Telegram API Rate Limiting Solution

## üìã Problem Summary
The system was experiencing Telegram API rate limiting errors during parallel file processing:
```
A wait of 297 seconds is required
```

## üîß Implemented Solutions

### 1. **NotificationHandler Rate Limiting**
- **Minimum Interval**: 1-second delay between API calls
- **Semaphore Protection**: Only one notification at a time
- **Rate Limit Detection**: Automatic detection of "wait of X seconds" errors
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retry with increased wait times
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Up to 3 retry attempts with proper error handling

### 2. **Batch Notification System**
- **Progress Milestones**: Notifications only at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% progress
- **Reduced API Calls**: Fewer individual file notifications during parallel processing
- **Batch Summary**: Complete batch statistics at the end

### 3. **Orchestrator Progress Tracking**
- **Centralized Counting**: Track total, completed, successful, and failed files
- **Smart Progress Updates**: Only send notifications at important milestones
- **Batch Completion Summary**: Final report with success rates

### 4. **Worker Quiet Mode**
- **Individual Notifications**: Reduced individual file success/failure notifications
- **Orchestrator Integration**: Workers report progress to orchestrator instead of sending individual notifications
- **Rate-Limited Communication**: All notifications go through rate-limited handler

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
1. **`telegramuploader/handlers/notification.py`**
   - Added rate limiting logic
   - Implemented retry mechanisms
   - Added batch notification methods

2. **`telegramuploader/orchestrator.py`**
   - Added progress tracking
   - Integrated batch notifications
   - Added total/success/failure counters

3. **`telegramuploader/workers/producer.py`**
   - Added quiet mode support
   - Integrated orchestrator progress updates

4. **`telegramuploader/workers/consumer.py`**
   - Added quiet mode support
   - Integrated orchestrator progress updates

## üìä Rate Limiting Features

### Automatic Rate Limit Detection
```python
async def _handle_rate_limit_error(self, error_message: str):
    # Extract wait time from "A wait of X seconds is required"
    import re
    match = re.search(r'(\d+) seconds is required', str(error_message))
    if match:
        wait_seconds = int(match.group(1))
        # Wait required time + 5 seconds buffer
        self.rate_limited_until = time.time() + wait_seconds + 5
```

### Smart Interval Management
```python
async def _enforce_rate_limit(self):
    # Respect active rate limits
    if current_time < self.rate_limited_until:
        wait_time = self.rate_limited_until - current_time
        await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
    
    # Enforce minimum interval between requests
    time_since_last = current_time - self.last_request_time
    if time_since_last < self.min_interval:
        wait_time = self.min_interval - time_since_last
        await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
```

### Batch Progress Notifications
```python
def _should_send_progress_notification(self, progress_percent: float) -> bool:
    """Only send notifications at key milestones"""
    milestones = [25, 50, 75, 100]
    return any(abs(progress_percent - milestone) < 1 for milestone in milestones)
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### Before Rate Limiting:
- ‚ùå Multiple "wait of 297 seconds" errors
- ‚ùå Failed parallel file processing
- ‚ùå Excessive API calls during downloads
- ‚ùå System instability under load

### After Rate Limiting:
- ‚úÖ Automatic rate limit detection and handling
- ‚úÖ Smooth parallel file processing
- ‚úÖ Reduced API call frequency
- ‚úÖ Stable system operation
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking with milestone notifications
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive batch completion reports

## üö¶ Usage Guidelines

### For Normal Operations:
- System automatically handles rate limits
- Progress notifications sent at key milestones
- Batch summary provided at completion

### For Heavy Workloads:
- Rate limiting automatically activates under load
- Individual file notifications reduced to prevent API abuse
- Orchestrator provides centralized progress tracking

### Monitoring:
- Watch logs for rate limit warnings: `"‚è∞ Rate limit: X seconds waiting..."`
- Monitor API call frequency in notification handler
- Check batch completion summaries for success rates

## üîÆ Future Improvements

1. **Configurable Rate Limits**: Make intervals configurable per environment
2. **API Call Metrics**: Add detailed API usage analytics
3. **Dynamic Rate Adjustment**: Adjust intervals based on actual API response times
4. **Notification Queuing**: Queue notifications during high rate limit periods
5. **Priority Notifications**: Different priorities for different notification types
